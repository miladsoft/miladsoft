# Hello, hei! 💛🖤

## I'm ✨**Milad Raeisi**✨

I'm a passionate software architect, developer, and UI/UX designer with a strong focus on decentralized technologies, blockchain, and AI. As a core member of **Blockcore**, my mission is to push the boundaries of decentralization and blockchain innovation.

Currently, I am working on **Angor**, a **decentralized Bitcoin crowdfunding platform** that empowers creators and investors alike through Bitcoin's decentralized network.

I dedicate most of my time to building open-source projects that empower society and inspire positive change in the world 🌍. My journey in technology has led me to specialize in several fields, including:

- **Blockchain Development** (Bitcoin, Decentralized Identity, Web3)
- **Software Architecture** (Full-stack development, TypeScript, APIs, .NET, C#)
- **AI & Data Science** (Building intelligent systems and data-driven applications)
- **UI/UX Design** (Crafting intuitive and engaging user experiences)
